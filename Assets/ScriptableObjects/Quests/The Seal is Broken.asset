  objective: Seal 12 Sha Fissures to banish the Sha of Doubt.
  description: '<Cho looks at you in disbelief.>

    I... I thought Sha of this
    immensity were a myth - we all did. Just a story to keep our children from fighting.

    No
    time to talk now. Those fissures - they''re feeding it... it grows stronger by
    the moment!

    I must research the scrolls from my family archives. You, take
    this cannon and ride Mishi.

    You must find a way to contain this horror that
    has been unleashed!'
